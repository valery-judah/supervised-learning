## Gradient Descent

`gradient_descent.py` contains a minimal implementation of batch gradient
descent for linear regression. The module can be executed directly to see a
small example:

```bash
python gradient_descent.py
```

This will fit a simple model to synthetic data and print the learned
parameters along with the final cost.
